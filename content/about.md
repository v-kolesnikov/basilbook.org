I’m the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [Bookmate](https://bookmate.com), where I work on the company’s technology stack and manage the greatest engineering team I've ever met.

Before Bookmate I worked at biggest Russian TV channels as TV & Video engineer, then switched to software development and spent about 3 years in several companies doing e-shop and mass-media products and services.

I'm in love with books which I have a lot and one is always a great present.
I also like history, reconstruction, art and meditation.
