## Intro

My name is Vasiliy Kolesnikov.

I'm a software engineer educated in the field of computer science and have accumulated management skills.

At different times I've programmed in different programming languages:

- C/C++, Java and Assembler at university
- Ruby has been my primary language since 2015. I also certificated by the Ruby Association as [Ruby Programmer Gold version 2.1](https://www.credential.net/773cdc56-cc8f-4f47-b5d5-0a84e8af3c4a)
- Clojure and Elixir - my favorite hobby languages

The last four years (2017 - 2021) I've worked for [Bookmate.com](https://bookmate.com) and it's my most relevant experience.

I started here in 2017 as principal engineer in back-end team and worked on the one of the most unknown ("legacy") part of the system which nevertheless was crucial for business team. Five months later, a new system was built that worked significantly more efficiently and more stable. This system works to this day and over the past four years, almost did not require any modifications and fixes.

Then in 2018 I started working on a brand new project for the company. As part of a very small team of 4 people, we created an alternative product that includes a fully functional application server, website and mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms. It was a great success and from that moment on, I actually began to work more and more not only as an engineer, but also as a project manager. Later that year, the project was spun off into a separate subsidiary and I took over as CTO.

In 2019, I took over the parent company (Bookmate) as CTO.
