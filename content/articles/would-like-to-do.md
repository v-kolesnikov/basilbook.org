Working as a manager (and being ex-developer) I mostly don't have a possibility to work directly on code.
However I still get delighted when I see good engineering solutions.
And every that time I wish to seat down and implement these solutions by myself.
So I decided to make a list of issues and solutions (including but not limiting) I like and on which I would like to work if I would so lucky to work as a developer some day again.

- Build HTTP APIs
  - Request/Response shape
  - Authentication
  - Logging
  - Security
  - Performance
  - Specification first
  - OpenAPI
  - GraphQL
  - Documentation
  - 100% integration tests coverage
  - Compatibility, versions, deprecations
- Design database and domain model
- Analyze the experience with existing API (probably "legacy") and design its next version with and without breaking changes
- Write API documentation, working as a tech writer, building the doc site
- [HTTP API versioning](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning)
- [API evolution](https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design)
- [Minimal Modeling](https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/)
- [High efficient logging](https://brandur.org/canonical-log-lines)
- Write code on Ruby (Gold level certification)
- Write code on Clojure
- Write code on Elixir
- Build the next gen internet services (what is "next gen"? we could decide that together!)
- My beloved domain to work on is *books* (printed, e-books, audio-books, comics)
- Strong knowledge of e-book standards: EPUB, ONIX, BISAC, MOBI, CBZ etc
- Strong knowledge of OpenAPI standard, experienced in writing OpenAPI tools

to be continued...
